# rockpaperscissors
This Python script is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. It tracks wins, losses, ties, and rounds played. The game continues in a loop until the player chooses to stop by pressing 's'. Choices are compared, and scores are updated and displayed after each round.

Player Input:

If the user chooses to play, they input either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

Computer's Choice:

The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
